# Orbit-Hacks: Smart Parking System 🚗🅿️

A smart parking system created during a **48-hour hackathon** by our dedicated team:  
- **Sarad Babu Shrestha**  
- **Yasmini Gyawali**  
- **Sairoj Prasai**  
- **Sudip Timalsina**

## 🚀 Project Overview

In just two days, our team developed a smart and efficient parking system designed to address parking challenges in urban areas. Our goal was to create a system that optimizes parking availability, reduces congestion, and enhances user convenience.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Real-time Parking Availability**: Displays the number of available parking spaces in real-time.  
- **Booking System**: Users can reserve parking spots in advance through the platform.  
- **Navigation Assistance**: Provides directions to the selected parking spot.  
- **Payment Integration**: Facilitates secure payments for parking.  
- **Admin Panel**: Allows parking lot owners to monitor and manage their parking spaces.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for an interactive and responsive user interface.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for API and server-side operations.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user, booking, and parking information.  
- **Third-Party APIs**: Integrated for maps and payment processing.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Urban areas often face challenges with limited parking spaces and inefficient management systems. **Orbit-Hacks** aims to streamline the parking experience for both users and parking managers, making urban commuting smoother.
